and multiples to calculate the total HR. The input data 
structures are a bit particular. Expects multiple simulations.}

  \item{data}{Matrix/df of data with observations as rows, and 
columns containing covariate data}
  \item{bootrows}{Matrix/df of row indicators that can be applied to
the data to recover different bootstraps of the
data. Each column is a different bootstrap of the
data.}

additional data corresponding to each dataset
indicated by bootrows}

containing covariate combinations and the 
corresponding HR}
}

\value{A matrix of total HRs for each observation under each
simulation. Thus, has the same dimensions as the input
matrix "bootrows"}
