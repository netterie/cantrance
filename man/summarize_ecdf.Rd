\title{Summarize multiple empirical cdfs by covariate groups}
\description{Compute the empirical cdf of a distribution
for multiple simulations and return the distribution
of medians and a summary of the cdfs at each of the
specified "xvalues"}
\usage{summarize_ecdf(data, xvalues = seq(0, 10, 0.5), covar, covar.order = NULL)}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{A matrix where columns are different simulations of
the data distribution and rows are individuals}
  \item{xvalues}{A vector of values for which to return the cdf
probabilities}
  \item{covar}{Vector of covariate values for each individual 
by which cdf summaries should be computed}
  \item{covar.order}{Vector of the covariate values in their preferred
order}
}

\value{A list of 1) Median survivals for each simulation (rows)
by covariate group (columns), 2) Same as #1 except
means, and 3) Median, lower, and upper bound across 
simulations of survival probabilities at each timepoint
specified in xvalues, by covariate group (indicated by rownames)}
