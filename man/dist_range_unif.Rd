\usage{dist_range_unif(n, rng, splitchar = "-", to.round.int = FALSE)}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{Number of values to return from a uniform 
distribution defined by rng}
  \item{rng}{String containing a range of values, separated by
splitchar, to be expanded into n individual values}
  \item{splitchar}{String character separating two values in rng}
  \item{to.round.int}{If results will be rounded to the nearest integer,
set to TRUE. This will expand the allowable range 
for simulation so that integers in the range are
evenly distributed after rounding }
}

\value{A vector of length n}
